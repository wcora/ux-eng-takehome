About the code:

All of the files you will need to edit or add to are in the EDIT_HERE folder. This code samples uses some of the packages we currently use at Tulip: typescript, lodash, styled components and react. Typescript checking is turned off (the app will still build with errors), and it is not necessary to typescript your work. Likewise, we use styled components, but you can also import css files or do inline styling.

To run this application / do the takehome:

1. First install dependencies by running `yarn`. (you may need to install yarn)
2. Start the server with `yarn start`.
3. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the instructions.
4. Spend 3-4 hours making the code changes described in the instructions.
5. Create a new commit with your name in the branch, and create a new PR.
